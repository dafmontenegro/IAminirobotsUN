### [prisoners-dilemma-cellular-automata](https://github.com/dafmontenegro/IAminirobotsUN/blob/master/prisoners-dilemma-cellular-automata/prisoners-dilemma-cellular-automata.ipynb)
A Python project that explores the dynamics of cooperation and competition through the lens of game theory. By transforming **cellular automata into strategies** and employing classic tactics like **Tit For Tat,** the project investigates the performance of various strategies in the context of the **Prisoner's Dilemma.**

### [Gabo RAG](https://github.com/dafmontenegro/gabo-rag)
'Gabo' is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to enhance the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) such as 'Llama 3.1' or 'Phi 3.5'. This project honors Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez by marking the tenth anniversary of his death, creating a specialized assistant to answer questions about his work, and using new technologies to further reveal his literary legacy.

### [pi-tensorflow-lite-object-detection](https://github.com/dafmontenegro/pi-tensorflow-lite-object-detection)
This project builds a real-time object detection system using a Raspberry Pi and a camera. It captures live video, processes it with a TensorFlow Lite model to detect specific objects, and saves important events as video files.

### [Voronoi Diagrams](https://github.com/FabianMontes/Voronoi-diagrams)
This Proyect is a built of a interactive creator or Voronoi diagrams, using the centers given by the user by clicking it draws the desire Voronoi Diagram.

### [HeatTracker](https://github.com/FabianMontes/HeatTracker)

The HeatTracker Proyect is designed to paint the places where an object of interest has been, showing the places where it most spent time.
Designed as a complement of *the pi-tensorflow-lite-object-detection* it analized the data that this proyect recives to show the map of places where the object has been.

### [virussimulation](https://github.com/FabianMontes/virussimulation)

This is a Simulation made in NetLogo exposed in the class. The simulation will model how a virus spreads among various patient types, using a grid-based system where each cell represents an individual. The cells follow the rules of **cellular automata**, determining the state of each patient  based on the states of neighboring cells and predefined conditions.
